# Factorem Frontend 

This is the frontend for the Factorem application, a platform for ordering custom manufactured parts. This application is built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview

The main page of the application is a landing page that introduces Factorem and its services. It allows users to upload their design files, select a manufacturing process, and request a quote.

### Key Features

*   **File Upload:** Users can upload their design files through a drag-and-drop interface or a file browser. The application supports various file types, including `.step`, `.stp`, `.sldprt`, `.x_t`, `.ai`, `.pdf`, and `.zip`.
*   **Service Selection:** Users can choose from a range of manufacturing services, including CNC Machining, Sheet Metal Fabrication, and 3D Printing.
*   **Instant Quoting:** The application provides an "instant quote" feature, which is simulated in the current version.
*   **Trusted Partners:** The application displays a list of trusted partners to build confidence with users.
